	<h1>About the Club</h1>
	<h3>Anyone, regardless of major or background, can join us</h3>
	    <p><strong>Everyone</strong>, regardless of major, background, etc. is welcome to join the club and work on their own game while surrounded by great peers and mentors. Game development is not only programming. We need artists, writers, musicians, sound technicians, designers, and more. You have to understand that not only is game development a very interdiscplinary field, but great game ideas come from having a diverse team</p>
	<h3>Our club doesn't work on 1 large game together. You get to work on <em>your</em>(and your friends') game alongside other developers</h3>
    <p>Our philosophy is that you will be driven by an unstoppable force when you get to work on your own game. We differentiate from other game development clubs in that we give you the freedom to pursue the game <strong>YOU</strong> want to build instead of working in a team on <em>someone else's</em> game. It means you get more freedom, but it also means you have to be more <em>independent</em>.
	<h3>For the inexperienced, we have 2 different activities each year to help you get started</h3>
		<ol id="aboutOL">
			<li>During the fall semester, we'll be teaching the fundamentals through many series of workshops and club activities.</li>
			<li>During the spring semester, people who would like to work on a team with an experienced mentor can sign up for our annual game fair. Your goal would be to complete a demo of a game idea by the end of the semester</li>
        </ol>
	<h3>This semester we meet every Thursday from 6pm-8pm in LWSN B160</h3>
		<p>During our meetings, we'll most likely have people talk about the progress of their game, then go onto the activities for the inexperienced people. For the more veteran people, you can come here as a work place to meet up with other game developers, work on your game in a cool environment, or help us host the workshops/mentor teams for the inexperienced people.</p>

#about
#Our philosophy is that you will be driven by an unstoppable passion when you get to work on your own game
	We differentiate from other game development clubs in that we give you the freedom to pursue not just the role you want, but the kind of game you want to build. We are free, but it also means we are independent and drive ourselves.

	If working independently on your own game isn't the type of flavor you like, worry not. There are other game development clubs on campus:
	<link to SIGGD>
	<link to Purdue VR>
	<link to Purdue Game Dev>

#We have $5 semester dues, but we have access to several Oculus Rifts, art assets, and much more to come

#We have 2 different main activities that are dependent on the year.
	(1) during the fall semester, we teach and learn by hosting workshops (we'd love new people to share their knowledge!) and having people bond with one another
	(2) during the spring semester, we focus on our annual game fair, where people, either on their own or with their friends, try to complete a demo of their game.

#This semester we meet every Thursday from 6pm-8pm in LWSN B160

#Game development is not only programming. We need artists, writers, musicians, sound technicians, designers, and more
	Everyone is welcome to join the club as long as you have the passion, willingness to work hard, and are capable of independently motivate yourself to accomplish your goals.
