1. Fixed splash page so the images are positioned perfectly regardless of screen dimensions
2. Removed centered() function from javascript (instead centering the title with CSS)
3. Added sans-serif to all font-family: Montserrat calls for in case the user can't install fonts
4. Fixed the background-repeat: no-repeat; error

6. Changed default color of text-shadow of title to match that of the JS color
7. Fixed the game catalog so the text doesn't disappear if the person has a low width screen

9. Added code for question card generation
