##Style Guide

###CSS
When you want to add a new style to our codebase, make sure it's sorted in the following way:

1. Elements (e.g. <a>, <div>) go first, classes go second, and ID's go last. This is sorted this way due to the cascading nature of CSS.
2. Within the elements/classes/ID's sections, keep it sorted in *alphabetical order*.
